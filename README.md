# glider

## Experiment

The following experiment uses the long free as forecast for the 1st window (Exp35_2380)
- Exp35: assimilating SST, HFR, SSH. 
The following experiments use Exp35_2389/NL as the forecast for their first windows. 
- Exp36: assimilating glider T,S
- Exp37: assimilating glider T,S, SST, SSH and HFR
- Exp38: assimilating glider T
- Exp39: assimilating glider T,S but with fixed observational stan. dev. \sigma_T=0.1C, \sigma_S=0.02ppt
- Exp40: no assimilation
- Exp41: assimilating glider T,S and SST
- Exp42: assimilating glider T,S and HFR 
- Exp43: assimilating glider T,S but with fixed observation stan. dev. \sigma_T=0.4C, \simga_S=0.06ppt

The last window contains NL/Long with the continuation experiment after last forecast.
